This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast.",

Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many.
